## Exercise 1:
Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all the numbers in a given list.

Question:
Write a Python function called `sum_list_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

## Solution 1: Sum of all numbers in a list
```python
def sum_list_numbers(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the sum of all the numbers in a given list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of all the numbers in the list.
    """
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    return sum
```
### Explanation: The function `sum_list_numbers` takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the sum of the numbers. Then, it iterates over each number in the list using a for loop and adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the calculated sum.

## Exercise 2:
Write a Python program to find the maximum number in a given list.

Question:
Write a Python function called `find_max_number` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the maximum number in the list.

## Solution 2: Maximum number in a list
```python
def find_max_number(numbers):
    """
    Finds the maximum number in a given list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numbers.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number in the list.
    """
    max_num = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```
### Explanation: The function `find_max_number` takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes a variable `max_num` to the first element of the list. Then, it iterates over each number in the list using a for loop and compares it with the current maximum number. If a number is greater than the current maximum, it updates the `max_num` variable. Finally, it returns the maximum number found.

## Exercise 3:
Write a Python program to check if a given number is prime or not.

Question:
Write a Python function called `is_prime` that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

## Solution 3: Check if a number is prime
```python
def is_prime(number):
    """
    Checks if a given number is prime.

    Args:
        number (int): The number to be checked.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
### Explanation: The function `is_prime` takes a number as input. It first checks if the number is less than 2 because numbers less than 2 are not prime. Then, it iterates from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive) and checks if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is divisible, it means the number is not prime, and the function returns False. If no divisors are found, it means the number is prime, and the function returns True.

## Exercise 4:
Write a Python program to reverse a given string.

Question:
Write a Python function called `reverse_string` that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string.

## Solution 4: Reverse a string
```python
def reverse_string(string):
    """
    Reverses a given string.



    Args:
        string (str): The string to be reversed.

    Returns:
        str: The reversed string.
    """
    return string[::-1]
```
### Explanation: The function `reverse_string` takes a string as input. It uses slicing with a step of -1 to reverse the string. The reversed string is then returned.

## Exercise 5:
Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each element in a given list.

Question:
Write a Python function called `count_element_occurrences` that takes a list of elements as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are the counts of their occurrences in the list.

## Solution 5: Count occurrences of elements in a list
```python
def count_element_occurrences(elements):
    """
    Counts the occurrences of each element in a given list.

    Args:
        elements (list): List of elements.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with elements as keys and their occurrences as values.
    """
    occurrences = {}
    for element in elements:
        occurrences[element] = occurrences.get(element, 0) + 1
    return occurrences
```
### Explanation: The function `count_element_occurrences` takes a list of elements as input. It initializes an empty dictionary called `occurrences` to store the counts of each element. Then, it iterates over each element in the list using a for loop. For each element, it uses the `get()` method of the dictionary to retrieve its current count. If the element is not yet present in the dictionary, it returns 0. The count is incremented by 1, and the updated count is assigned to the element in the dictionary. Finally, the dictionary with element occurrences is returned.

## Exercise 6:
Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a given list.

Question:
Write a Python function called `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed.

## Solution 6: Remove duplicates from a list
```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers):
    """
    Removes duplicates from a given list.

    Args:
        numbers (list): List of numbers.

    Returns:
        list: List with duplicate elements removed.
    """
    unique_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in unique_numbers:
            unique_numbers.append(num)
    return unique_numbers
```
### Explanation: The function `remove_duplicates` takes a list of numbers as input. It initializes an empty list called `unique_numbers` to store the numbers without duplicates. Then, it iterates over each number in the input list using a for loop. For each number, it checks if it is already present in the `unique_numbers` list using the `not in` operator. If the number is not in the list, it means it is unique, and it is appended to the `unique_numbers` list. Finally, the list without duplicate elements is returned.

## Exercise 7:
Write a Python program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

Question:
Write a Python function called `check_anagram` that takes two strings as input and returns True if the strings are anagrams of each other, and False otherwise.

## Solution 7: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other
```python
def check_anagram(str1, str2):
    """
    Checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.

    Args:
        str1 (str): First string.
        str2 (str): Second string.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.
    """
    sorted_str1 = sorted(str1)
    sorted_str2 = sorted(str2)
    return sorted_str1 == sorted_str2
```
### Explanation: The function `

check_anagram` takes two strings as input. It first sorts both strings using the `sorted()` function, which rearranges the characters in alphabetical order. The sorted strings are then compared using the `==` operator to check if they are equal. If the sorted strings are equal, it means the original strings are anagrams of each other, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
